# Pyqt5CanvasTest
Testing out PyQT5

This project is for me to learn more about python and also see how good PyQT5 is.

Lesson one: i Figure out how to asynchronously load images from web or disk.
    I did this by using the thread pool and QRunnable to run a asynch task.
    This was painful to figure out since web had lots of bad advice on this.
    It turns out to be pretty simple. 

Lesson two: I figured out how to zoom and pan an image using QGraphicsScene and QGraphicsView and how 
to zoom and pan around a mouse point
